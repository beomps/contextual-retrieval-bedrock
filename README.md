# Contextual Retrieval with Amazon Bedrock and OpenSearch

This project implements [Contextual Retrieval](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval), as introduced by Anthropic, using Amazon Bedrock, Amazon OpenSearch Service and Cohere Reranker Model. 

## What is Contextual Retrieval?
- Problem: Traditional RAG often provides incomplete information due to chunk size limitations.
- Solution: Provide the entire document as context along with each chunk to create chunk-specific context.

## Note on Contextual Retrieval and Prompt Caching:
Contextual Retrieval is a preprocessing technique that can be implemented without prompt caching. While prompt caching can improve cost-effectiveness and performance, __the current implementation using Amazon Bedrock does not include this feature__. Prompt caching support will be added in future updates when Bedrock makes it available.

In our tests processing the entire manual for Amazon Bedrock (1600+ pages, https://d1jp7kj5nqor8j.cloudfront.net/bedrock-manual.pdf) with the Claude 3 Haiku model in us-west-2, the preprocessing costs were under $20 even without prompt caching. However, generating the situated context for 1600 pages took 1-2 hour without using asynchronous calls.

Sample usage statistics:
- Input Tokens: 58,573,002 (Cost: $14.64)
- Output Tokens: 385,712 (Cost: $0.48)
- Total Tokens: 58,958,714

Note: Costs may vary significantly depending on prompt and document length.


## Key Features (Demo.)

- Streamlit-based chatbot application using Bedrock's LLM and embedding models
- Multi-turn conversations with chat history

#### Preprocessing

- PDF upload and preprocessing support in the chat interface
- Hyierachical Chunking for Contextual Retrieval
- OpenSearch integration for storing preprocessed chunks

#### Searching

- Rank fusion implementation
    - Hybrid Search implementation using KNN and BM25 scores
    - API Gateway and Lambda configuration for serving the Rerank API
- Reranking with Cohere Rerank 3 Nimble model deployed on Amazon SageMaker

#### Evaluation (RAGAS) - Optional

- Uploading Q&A dataset for evaluation
- Evaluation based on RAGAS metrics
    - Answer Relevancy / Faithfulness / Context Recall / Context Precision
- The evaluation time increases proportionally with the number of metrics being evaluated and the number of rows in the evaluation dataset.
